They may initiate the polymerization of isocyanates and epoxides. This chemical is incompatible with strong oxidizers. (NTP, 1992)"

Contact with 2-butanone increases the rate of peroxide formation. An explosive reaction occurs when it is heated with (aluminum isopropoxide + crotonaldehyde). Forms explosive mixtures with trinitromethane and hydrogen peroxide. Reacts with barium perchlorate to form a highly explosive compound. Ignites on contact with dioxygenyl tetrafluoroborate, chromium trioxide and potassium-tert-butoxide. Vigorous reactions occur with (hydrogen + palladium), nitroform, oleum, COCl2, aluminum triisopropoxide and oxidizing agents. Reacts explosively with phosgene in the presence of iron salts. Incompatible with acids, acid anhydrides, halogens and aluminum (NTP, 1992). Isopropanol can react with PCl3, forming toxic HCl gas. (Logsdon, John E., Richard A. Loke., ""Isopropyl Alcohol.""
