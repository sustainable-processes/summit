Experiments / Benchmarks
========================

The :class:`~summit.experiment.Experiment` class provides a generic way of representing chemical reactions, virtual or real. We leverage this class to create the benchmarks available in Summit. You can also create your own benchmarks based on experimental data (see here_). To get some insight into how to hook Summit up to real experiments, look at the introductory tutorial_.

Here, we present the already implemented benchmarks and show you how to create new onces.
