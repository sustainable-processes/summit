Experiments / Benchmarks
========================

The :class:`~summit.experiment.Experiment` class provides a generic way of representing chemical reactions, virtual or real. We leverage this class to create the benchmarks available here. To get some insight into how to hook Summit up to real experimetns, look at the tutorial_.

Here, we present the already implemented benchmarks and show you how to create new onces.
